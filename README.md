# Project Overview

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application. It aims to create a full-stack web application for building and managing a frontend for a MERN-based project.

The project structure is organized into frontend and backend directories. The frontend directory contains all the client-side code written in React.js, while the backend directory contains the server-side code written in Node.js using Express.js.

The main features of this project include:

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for managing project data
- Real-time updates using websockets
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage
- Responsive and user-friendly UI design

To get started with this project, follow the installation instructions provided in the respective frontend and backend directories. Make sure to have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine.

Feel free to explore the codebase and customize it according to your project requirements.
